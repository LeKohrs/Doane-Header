At minimum, you will need to populate the local application name and
repository path in package.json. After that you can install the default
plugins defined in Gruntfile.js and webpack.config.js by running this command:

    npm install

After installation, run 'npm run dev' from the command line in this project's
root folder in order to kick off the various watch tasks.

For deployment, Grunt is used.
